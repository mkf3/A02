## GIT? GITHUB? WEBSTORM? HOW CAN YOU USE THEM?

Below is a step by step tutorial on how to use them

Let's start with Github, What is Github? Why do you use it for?

Github is  a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. First thing you need to do before anything else, it's downloading the app, then signing up or creating a new account on the app or the website. You can use this link to create an account: https://github.com/.
Now, after signing up, you will need to create a repository. It can be either local or remote. A local repository will be located on your machine, each user/programmer has one. However, if you are working on a project with multiple developers. Each developer will push their updated versions from their local repository to the remote repository. Hence,  a remote repository is like a big storage room where each developer will save their changes or versions of the projects.

Now, once a change was pushed to the remote repository, each developer can clone it on their local repository. Then, each developer can make more changes or keep it as it is.There is a cool feature on github where you can merge the changes made from the remote repository to your local one. You will be able to see all changes that was made from the other developers compared to your own. If you want to pull a clone of a remote repository without saving it in your local repository, there is an useful command for it, "fetch". As explained previously mentioned, fetching can be useful for developers without affecting your local repository. 

Now, after merging, in any situation where two or more developers made changes in the same region, then Github will not know which one to keep or discard. In such cases, only human intervention may fix the issues. We call such issues "merge conflict".
Lastly, Github possesses an extremely important and useful feature called branch which can be considered as a history of all the commits made in a local repository. It is valuable since you may just go back to any previous repository if need be. 

Overall, Github is useful for developers to store and manage their codes. Simply put, you create a repository on your end (local) then you can push any changes to a remote repository if you are working in group. This inverse is also possible, you can pull or fetch a clone from the remote repository to your local repository. Sometimes, developers can decide to merge the changes made from the remote to their own repository. However, if two or more developers made changes in the same section, it will create a conflict. More importantly, Github keeps a history or branch of each commits made to your local repository.

Now, GIT? IS IT THE SAME AS GITHUB? CHOW CAN WE USE IT?

GIT and GITHUB have a lot of similarities even though they are different. Git possesses many commands and features similar to Github such as pull, push, fetch, merge, clone, branches, commit, local and remote repository. Similar to Github, you need to create an account before anything. Then, you create a local repository in order to access your codes. Contrary to Github, GIT is mostly used to keep track of changes to the codes of any projects. You can use commands such as pull, push and fetch to transfer changes from local to remote (push) or remote to local (pull or fetch).

Just like GITHUB, you may merge any changes from a remote repository to your local repository, and same as Github, you may encounter a conflict if changes were made in the same regions. You can save any changes mades to the code with the command "commit" and a history of these changes will be accesible through branches. You may use the command "git branch <name-of-new-branch>" to create a new branch and the following command "git checkout <name-of-the-branch>" to switch from one branch to another one.



















  ### GLOSSARY
Below is a glossary of the different terms that you may encouter while using Github, Git or Webstorm:

#### Branch:
It allows users to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
#### Clone: 
It allows an user to make a copy of a repository.

#### Commit:
It is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It allows you to keep a record of what changes were made by creating an unique ID.

#### Fetch:
It is a command that retrieves updates from a remote repository but does not merge them with your local branch. Itâ€™s like downloading the latest changes without applying them directly to your working directory.

#### GIT:
It is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code of the projects.

#### Github:
It is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.

#### Merge:
It is a fundamental command in the Git version control system that integrates changes from one branch into another.

#### Merge Conflict:
It happens when two branches both modify the same region of a file and are subsequently merged. Git can't know which of the changes to keep, and thus needs human intervention to resolve the conflict.

#### Push:
It allows us (programmers) to transfer files from the local repository to remote repository hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

#### Pull:
It  is a command which is used to fetch and integrate the changes which are present in the remote repository to the local repository.

#### Remote:
It is a command used to manage a set of tracked repositories, often referred to as "remotes". A remote is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. 

#### Repository:
It is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.
