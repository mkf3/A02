#### *Clone: 
It allows an user to make a copy of a repository.

#### *Commit:
It is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It allows you to keep a record of what changes were made by creating an unique ID.

It  is a command that retrieves updates from a remote repository but does not merge them with your local branch. It’s like downloading the latest changes without applying them directly to your working directory.

#### *GIT:
It is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code of the projects

#### * Github:
It is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.

#### *Merge:
It is a fundamental command in the Git version control system that integrates changes from one branch into another.

#### *Merge Conflict:
It happens when two branches both modify the same region of a file and are subsequently merged. Git can't know which of the changes to keep, and thus needs human intervention to resolve the conflict.

#### *Push:
It allows us (programmers) to transfer files from the local repository to remote repository hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

#### *Pull:
It  is a command which is used to fetch and integrate the changes which are present in the remote repository to the local repository.

#### *Remote:
It is a command used to manage a set of tracked repositories, often referred to as "remotes". A remote is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. 

#### *Repository:
It is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.
